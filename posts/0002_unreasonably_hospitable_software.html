<h1>Unreasonably Hospitable Software</h1>

<h1>TL;DR</h1>

<p>To evaluate software we so often use criteria like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it working?</li>
<li>Is it fast?</li>
<li>Is it clean?</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to strongly encourage adding <em>“Is this helpful?”</em> to this list.</p>

<p>I recently finished <em>Unreasonable Hospitality</em> by Will Guidara and couldn’t help but feel its lessons extend far beyond the restaurant industry and should be required reading for software engineers.</p>

<p>A quick summary of the book is that Guidara transformed Eleven Madison Park into the best restaurant in the world — not just through outstanding food, but through relentless, unreasonable hospitality. His philosophy being there is no ceiling to how thoughtful and helpful we can be to each other.</p>

<p>If you’ve seen the Hulu show The Bear (and you should), you’ll recognize some of the stories from the book:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A waiter overheard guests regretting not trying a New York street hotdog. Moments later, they were served fresh ones - straight from a nearby cart.</p></li>

<li><p>Staff secretly checked where customers had parked and fed their meters so they could enjoy their meal without worrying about tickets.</p></li>

<li><p>A regular customer was raising money for their business and was short by a few hundred thousand dollars. On their next visit, they found a small sack under their chair, stamped with a dollar sign. Inside were 100 Grand chocolate bars.</p></li>

<li><p>Noticing guests were flipping their artisanal plates to see who made them, it was mandatory that plates were placed so the maker’s stamp was oriented correctly when they were turned over.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>None of these gestures were expensive or high-effort, yet they made customers feel seen and valued. That’s the core of Guidara’s philosophy: hospitality should be unreasonable because the smallest thoughtful details can have the biggest impact.</p>

<p>A lot of businesses confuse luxury with hospitality. Each of the stories above could have ended with “here’s a $5,000 bottle of champagne, compliments of the house” - luxurious, yes, but memorable, personal, thoughtful, helpful? Not remotely.</p>

<h3>What if we applied this level of hospitality to software engineering?</h3>

<p>As engineers, we’re trained to find problems and fix them. But if we’re not careful, this can lead to a culture where we focus so much on what’s broken that we forget to optimize for helpfulness.</p>

<p>Can we take Guidara’s philosophy and apply it to our code, tools, and our engineering culture?</p>

<p>Some time ago, I needed to trace data through a microservice. My team didn’t own the service, and I didn’t need deep technical details - just a broad understanding. I reached out to an engineer who I thought had worked with it.</p>

<p>They essentially shrugged and said, “The repo has tests, so you can read those.”</p>

<p>Technically correct? Sure. But productive? Not really.</p>

<p>With no docs, no README, and no clear owner, my best option was to dig through test cases and reverse-engineer what was happening. This was nuts to me - inhospitable, even.</p>

<p>Another time, I was troubleshooting a command-line tool that kicked off a build process. It would do nothing for six minutes, then exit. I asked for some kind of progress output, something to indicate whether it was working or failing.</p>

<p>The engineer I spoke to pushed back: “Plenty of CLI tools don’t output anything: rm, mv, cp, etc.”</p>

<p>Again, technically correct. But imagine a world where those commands did provide a little more feedback — would that make them 1% more helpful? I’d strongly argue yes.</p>

<h3>What Does Hospitable Software Look Like?</h3>

<p>To evaluate software we so often use criteria like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it working?</li>
<li>Is it fast?</li>
<li>Is it clean?</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to strongly encourage adding <strong>“Is this helpful?”</strong> to this list.</p>

<p>Some widely used libraries and tools feel like they’re actively trying to be difficult to use: no docs, no README, not even a one-line description of what they do.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to overlook these areas if helpfulness was a factor in the development cycle.</p>

<h3>Guess the Number</h3>

<p>I feel the need to touch on some push back I’ve had to this way of working. Often in the form of “If you’re smart enough, you’ll figure it out. And we only want smart engineers.” I call this the Guess the Number problem.</p>

<p>Imagine I need a specific value to get my code working. You know the number, but instead of telling me, you say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Guess the number, it’s between 1 and 1000.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, I could guess. But should I have to? No. You could just tell me the number, and we’d both move on.</p>

<p>This sounds absurd, yet I see it happen all the time. I once used a Go SQL library with zero documentation. The GitHub issues were littered with the maintainers repeatedly telling users, “Just read the source code.”</p>

<p>Again - can I? Yes. But should I have to? Is it hospitable? No.</p>

<p>Great engineers don’t just solve problems; they remove unnecessary friction for others.</p>

<p>Writing code is just one part of delivering a high-quality product, just as food was only one part of what made Eleven Madison Park the best restaurant in the world. The true differentiator was the seamless experience. In software, this aspect is often overlooked, yet it’s just as critical to delivering a great product.</p>
